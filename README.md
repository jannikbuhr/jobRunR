## Installation

You can install jobRunR from [github](https://github.com/) with:

remotes::install_github("jannikbuhr/jobRunR")

## Example

Use this package as an RStudio addin, there is
no need to load it explicitly. Simply select a piece
of code and use the addin menue to run it as a job.

This means that it also works from Rmarkdown documents
with a chunk highlighted (press Ctrl+Shif+Up to expand
the selection as far as needed).
